## The Car Shop
***
I have made this react project for a specific purpose. It is a car buying site for an the company "The Car Shop". Of course, it's dynamic. A visitor can:
* See the the latest collection of cars specially cars from world famous brands
* After seeing the cars, one can see the the details of that car
* A user can see the ratings of the cars
* After seeing details of a car, he/she can also add that car to the cart
* Visitors themselves can add any car as a seller if there's permission 
* It is responsive, so he can use and see updates from mobile

## The Server
* The site receives data from a live server using MongoDB Database
* The server generates all the data dynamically to the site

## Packages & Technologies
* vite-react
* node
* firebase
* express
* mongoDB etc.
